Please, be aware that, at this point, most of the functions need to be optimizated. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to be collaborative and it is expected to grow with time as **wrfseRs**  help to optimize, improve and extend this <a href=\"https://github.com/ilopezcoto/wrfR/\">wrfR</a> package. \r\n\r\n## Getting started:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary(devtools) \r\ninstall_github(\"ilopezcoto/wrfR\")\r\nlibrary(wrfR) \r\nhelp(wrfR)\r\n```\r\n## License:\r\n\r\n![](\"http://www.gnu.org/graphics/gplv3-127x51.png\")\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt\" >GPLv3</a>\r\n","google":"UA-53376765-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
