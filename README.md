## Description: 

The R WRF post processing tools is a suite of tools developed to ease working in R with projected meteorological and air quality netcdf files (Ref..), mostly coming from WRF and WRF-CHEM (Ref.) 

The current version v0.1 is a "raw" testing version developed on the base of some R functions I already had product of my research on atmospheric science. so, please, be aware that at this point most of the functions need a real optimization.

This project aims to be collaborative and expected to grow with time as useRs help to optimize, improve and extend this wrfR package.
