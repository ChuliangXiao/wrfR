\arguments{
\item{nc}{pointer to the WRF netcdf file as produced by \link{open.nc}}

\item{time_ind}{\code{integer} with the time index within the file being processed}

\item{vlev}{number of vertical levels (default = 10)}

\item{HGT_WRF}{2D terrain elevation array as produced by \link{getGRID}}

\item{lon_WRF}{2D WRF longitudes matrix as produced by \link{getGRID}}

\item{lat_WRF}{2D WRF latitudes matrix as produced by \link{getGRID}}

\item{WRFproj}{proj4 string witht the current projection as produced by \link{getGRID}}

\item{var4d}{vector of strings containing the name(s) of 4D WRF variable(s) to extract}

\item{var3d}{vector of strings containing the name(s) of 3D WRF variable(s) to extract}
}
\value{
list containing matrix objects for the variables \cr

}
\description{
\code{getWRFnatcube} extracts WRF default (meteorological variables) + additional variables to 3D cube (WRF_lon, WRF_lat, z)  from WRF files. It conserves the original lat lon
 \strong{WARNING:} this function may be slow and require a lot of memory depending on the input file size.
